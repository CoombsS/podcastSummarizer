----REQUIREMENTS-----
1) Access to Spotify API, which can be found here: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api
2) A chatGPT API with a paid account
3) Virtual cable to capture the Spotify output, any will do but I used: https://vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm?gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=11369121960&gbraid=0AAAAADjKyE59TJGT52mZMkUF01qGKc7PK&gclid=Cj0KCQjww-HABhCGARIsALLO6Xx8wwZiTFCyA9alAZkt-m-ssUm3Cb_qeHMcgT562_gOFovnSI46W8oaAgmIEALw_wcB
4) A premium spotify account (I don't know if it will work with a free account)

----TO USE-------
To run you can run via terminal by cd'ing into the directory you cloned the repository into, and running it through the terminal. 

-----WORKFLOW-------
When ran it will:
1) Check for directories for recordings of the Spotify episodes, and for the transcriptions; if none are found they are made
2) Web browser is then opened, playlist URL is navigated to, and then episode is played.
3) Recording is saved, episode is paused, then transcription begins
4) A PDF is made, with a summary of the episodes in batches of four for easy reading

---DISCLAIMER----
This project was made for personal use in order for me to digest a large volume of podcasts in a short amount of time. 
This was purely educational in nature, and made with the intention of furthering my knowledge in API calls, as well as helping others save their time.


----HEADS UP-----
The PDF function has not been tested, so I do not know if it works yet. Will probably check and fix it when I have more time, otherwise, enjoy the transcriptions!
